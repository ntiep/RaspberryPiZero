/**
 * testSPI.cpp This is a test program to utilize the MCP23S17 directly
 * using raw SPI calls according to the datasheet. It sets up BANKA and
 * BANKB as output pins and writes 10101010 and 01010101 to the bank
 * respectively. If LEDs are attached to PORT A (pins 21-28) and PORT B
 * (pins 8-1) then they will light in an alternating pattern.
